# MERN_Reading_List

#1 Create the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app reading_list-front-end". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.

#2 Delete the un-necessary files installed by the React Installation: App.test.js; logo.svg and setupTests.js. Remove the 'import logo' from App.js

#3 Remove all the default-css from App.css file. Also include code at the top of index.css to remove all the preset margins from default installation

***BASIC LAYOUT of the app was the first thing completed***

#4 Add the high level components to App.js file and then create the associated .js files and the .css files for the high level components in the src-folder

#5 Add minimal css to App.css for styling the main background and for styling the background of the <div> where the components are going to be displayed

#6 'rfce' to start with in each of the components will import the generic first few lines needed for each component

#7 Start with a generic <p> in each component and then import all the components (with CTRL + SPACEBAR) in the App.js file

#8 Add a bit of generic css to each of the component.css files in order to better see the different components

#9 Install @material-ui/core on the front-end to be able to import icons. Also install @material-ui/icons

#10 Major Time Spent Observation: spent alot of time trying to figure out the CSS to properly position everything. It is very helpful to 'border' all the <div>(s) to be able to see where things are and to move them around

#11 Completed the Add-New-Book-To-Reading-List section. Most of the time spent on the css to make it look cool. 

#12 On the Currently-Reading-Section, decided to call a component that will have the information in it. So in essence there will be a sub-component to this component

#13 On the Future-Reading-Section, decided to call a component that will have the information in it. So in essence there will be a sub-component to this component as well
