# MERN_Reading_List

#1 Create the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app reading_list-front-end". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.

#2 Delete the un-necessary files installed by the React Installation: App.test.js; logo.svg and setupTests.js. Remove the 'import logo' from App.js
